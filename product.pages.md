Our web app will be a series of pages each with their own URL.
Each page will be some different concept of visualizing or gamifying HS codes. 

Three page ideas:

1. The HS Code Explorer 🌳
The core idea is to visualize the HS code structure as a branching tree or a sunburst chart that users can navigate from the general to the specific. It turns the complex classification system into a simple journey of discovery.

1. The Core Visualization: "Product Family Tree"
Imagine the entire world of traded goods as one giant tree. The user's journey is to find a specific product's leaf on that tree.

Level 1: The Trunk (Sections): The visualization starts with the 21 main Sections of the HS system. These are broad categories like "Vegetable Products," "Textiles," or "Machinery." Each section is clearly labeled in simple terms.

Level 2: Main Branches (Chapters): When a user clicks a Section (e.g., "Section II: Vegetable Products"), it expands to show the relevant Chapters (the first 2 digits of the code). For example, Chapter 07 is "Edible vegetables" and Chapter 08 is "Edible fruit and nuts."

Level 3: Smaller Branches (Headings): Clicking a Chapter (e.g., "Chapter 08") reveals the Headings (the first 4 digits). For example, Heading 08.08 is "Apples, pears and quinces."

Level 4: The Leaves (Subheadings): Finally, clicking a Heading reveals the specific Subheadings (the full 6-digit code). For example, Subheading 0808.10 is "Apples."

As the user navigates, a "Code Builder" on the side of the screen visually assembles the HS code number by number, showing how each choice adds to the final code.

Example Journey for "Apples":

Click "Section II: Vegetable Products"

Click "Chapter 08: Edible fruit and nuts" (Code: 08....)

Click "Heading 08.08: Apples, pears and quinces" (Code: 0808..)

Click "Subheading 0808.10: Apples" (Final Code: 0808.10)

2. The Search Tool: Making it Relatable 🔍
The most important feature for a layman is a powerful search bar.

A user shouldn't need to know anything about the HS system to start. They can simply type in a product they know, like "iPhone," "coffee," or "cotton t-shirt."

When they search, the tool would:

Instantly find the correct HS code.

Animate the path through the hierarchical visualization, showing the user exactly how the system drills down to find that specific product.

Display the "Code Story" in plain language (e.g., "An iPhone is classified under 'Machinery and Electrical Equipment' > '...Telephones' > '...Telephones for cellular networks'").

3. The Game: "Trade Inspector" Challenge 🎮
To make learning active and fun, you could include a simple game.

The Goal: The user plays the role of a Trade Inspector and must correctly classify a series of products.

How it Works:

The game shows an image and name of a common product (e.g., a wooden chair, a leather handbag, a bicycle).

The user must use the interactive tree to navigate to the correct 6-digit HS code.

The game provides instant feedback at each level, guiding the user if they make a wrong turn. For example, if they click "Textiles" for a wooden chair, it might say, "Not quite! Look for the section that covers furniture."

Scoring: Users could be scored on speed and accuracy, encouraging them to play again and improve their understanding.

This combination of a visual explorer, a practical search tool, and a simple game creates a powerful and engaging way for anyone to learn and understand the logic behind HS codes without getting overwhelmed by technical jargon.
